# Smart Home Graduation Project

This is the README file for the Smart Home graduation project developed during a 1-month training at ITI (Information Technology Institute) in the field of embedded systems.

## Project Overview

The Smart Home project is aimed at designing and implementing a secure and automated home system. The system utilizes UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) communication between two microcontrollers to enable seamless interaction and control.

## Features

The key features of the Smart Home project include:

- Locker System: A dedicated locker system with password authentication has been implemented to provide secure storage for valuables.

- Password Verification: The system incorporates a password verification mechanism to ensure authorized access to the locker.

- Automation: The project emphasizes automation by enabling control and monitoring of various home appliances, such as lights, fans, and electronic devices, through the microcontrollers.

## Simulation Files

To facilitate understanding and testing of the project, simulation files in Proteus format have been provided. These files allow you to simulate the behavior of the project in a virtual environment.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Smart Home project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine.
2. Install Proteus software (if not already installed) to simulate the project.
3. Open the provided Proteus simulation files to explore the project's components and connections.
4. Connect two microcontrollers using UART communication as per the project specifications.
5. Compile and upload the code to the respective microcontrollers.
6. Test the functionality of the project by interacting with the locker system and verifying the password authentication.
